# 3D Block Breaker Game using Three.js

## Overview

This project is a 3D Block Breaker game developed using Three.js, a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in web applications. The game involves controlling a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The player scores points by breaking bricks and aims to clear all bricks without letting the ball fall.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from [https://github.com/Talha-Tayyab/3D-Block-Breaker](https://github.com/Talha-Tayyab/3D-Block-Breaker) to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports WebGL.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Controls

- **Paddle Movement**: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
- **Game Reset**: Click the "Restart Game" button to reset the game after it ends.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library used to create and render the 3D game environment.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for the structure and styling of the game interface.

## Features

- **3D Environment**: A 3D scene including a paddle, ball, and bricks.
- **Lighting**: Ambient and directional lighting for a better visual experience.
- **Player Controls**: Keyboard input for paddle movement.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects collisions between the ball and paddle, bricks, and walls.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the player's score.
- **Game Over and Reset**: Displays a game over message and provides a reset button to restart the game.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file defining the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the game's user interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game's logic, including scene setup, player controls, and collision detection.
